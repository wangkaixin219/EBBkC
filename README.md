# Efficient $k$-clique Listing: An Edge-Oriented Branching Strategy

This repository contains the codes and a technical report for $k$-clique listing with the edge-oriented branching strategy. 

## Setup

To run the codes correctly, please ensure you have installed `cmake (minimum version 3.16)` on your computer or server since we need to use cmake to generate `Makefile` to compile our codes. 
There are two steps to run our codes. The first step is a pre-processing procedure, which is to ensure that the graph contains no self-loops and no duplicate edges. The second step is the main listing procedure, which outputs all $k$-cliques. 

## Step 0 - Compile the codes

When you already download the codes, run the following commands to compile our codes. 

```bash
cd src/
mkdir build && cd build/
cmake ..
make
```

After running the codes, there will be an executable files called `BBkC`, which means you have already compiled our codes. 

## Step 1 - Pre-processing Procedure

When the graph is downloaded from the [Graph Repository](https://networkrepository.com/), the graph may have some comments at the very beginning, please ensure those comments are deleted before running the codes. The graph file may contain a number of edges, with each edge occupying a line (e.g., [nasasrb.edges](./dataset/nasasrb/nasasrb.edges)). Besides, the edges may also have some other attributes (e.g., [facebook.edges](./dataset/facebook/facebook.edges)). Our codes can handle both cases by only focusing on the first two elements of each edge, which represent the endpoints of the edge. 

To pre-process the graph, run the following command: 

```bash
./BBkC p /PATH_TO_EDGE_DATA
```

For example, 

```bash
./BBkC p ../../dataset/facebook/facebook.edges     # pre-process the `facebook` dataset
./BBkC p ../../dataset/nasasrb/nasasrb.edges      # pre-process the `nasasrb` dataset
```

For `facebook` dataset, since it contains many duplicate edges, it outputs

```
Pre-process ../../dataset/facebook/facebook.edges
... duplicates.
Pre-processed in 3917.07 ms
```

For `nasasrb`, since it contains no duplicate edges and no self-loops, it outputs

```
Pre-process ../../dataset/nasasrb/nasasrb.edges
Pre-processed in 4535.87 ms
```

The pre-processing procedure will output a file with the prefix same as the original file but end with `.clean`. Once this procedure is finished, we shall change the edge to another format using the libraries introduced by Prof. Lijun Chang. The code and its usage can be found in this [Repo](https://github.com/LijunChang/Cohesive_subgraph_book/tree/master/datasets). Once the the graph format is changed, each directory will have two binary files, one is b_adj.bin and the other is b_degree.bin.

## Step 2 - Serial Listing Procedure

To list $k$-cliques in the graph, we need to specify the value of $k$. In addition, we also need to specify a value of $t$ to control when we should conduct the early termination (details can be found in our paper). Therefore, the running command is: 

```bash
./BBkC e DIRECTORY_OF_BINARY_DATAS k_val t_val
```

For example, 

```bash
./BBkC e ../../dataset/facebook 20 3    # list 20-clique in `facebook` with early-termination in 3-plex 
./BBkC e ../../dataset/nasasrb 12 2     # list 12-clique in `nasasrb` with early-termination in 2-plex
```

For `facebook` dataset, it outputs

```
Reading edges from ../../dataset/facebook ...
|V| = 2543, |E| = 62844
Truss number = 35
Building necessary data structure ...
Iterate over all cliques
Number of 20-cliques: 1163924709
EBBkC+ET (t = 3) runtime 1391.73 ms
```

For `nasasrb` dataset, it outputs

```
Reading edges from ../../dataset/nasasrb ...
|V| = 54567, |E| = 1299405
Truss number = 23
Building necessary data structure ...
Iterate over all cliques
Number of 12-cliques: 7905736209
EBBkC+ET (t = 2) runtime 12683.40 ms
```

## Step 3 - Parallel Listing Procedure

To list $k$-cliques in the graph with multiple threads, we need to specify an additional parameter to indicate the number of threads to be used. Therefore, the running command is: 

```bash
./BBkC ep DIRECTORY_OF_BINARY_DATAS k_val t_val p_val
```

For example, 

```bash
./BBkC ep ../../dataset/nasasrb 12 3 16   # list 12-clique in `nasasrb` with early-termination in 3-plex with 16 threads
```

It should outputs

```
Reading edges from ../../dataset/nasasrb.index ...
|V| = 54567, |E| = 1299405
Truss number = 23
Building necessary data structure ...
Iterate over all cliques
